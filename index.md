### About me
I am an Autonomous Driving Software Engineer at [Isuzu](https://www.isuzutechcenter.com/) in Michigan, specializing in motion planning and machine learning.

I hold a master's degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/research/research-areas/robotics-autonomous-systems/) from the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I was a member of the [Image-Guided Medical Robotics Lab](https://medical.robotics.umich.edu/). During my time there, I conducted independent research focused on online trajectory generation for adaptive scanning under the supervision of Prof. Mark Draelos.

I earned my bachelor's degree in [Biomechatronics Engineering](https://www.bime.ntu.edu.tw/English/Default.html) from National Taiwan University (NTU). While at NTU, I collaborated with Prof. Ping-Lang Yen on agricultural robotics projects in the [Robots and Medical Mechatronics Lab](http://rmml.bime.ntu.edu.tw/nturmmle.html) and had the privilege of contributing to the development of Taiwan's first human-robot collaborative tea harvesting vehicle.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I am a singer with over 5 years of experience in acappella and chorus. Additionally, I have a passion for playing golf, enjoying scenic drives, and traveling.
