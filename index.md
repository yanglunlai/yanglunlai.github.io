### About me
I am now pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/research/research-areas/robotics-autonomous-systems/) (Robotics track) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). My interests lie in autonomous driving, motion planning, and machine learning. This summer, I will join [Isuzu Technical Center of America](https://www.isuzutechcenter.com/) as a PVRD Intern - Autonomous Driving Software Engineer Intern. I received my bachelor's degree in [Biomechatronics Engineering](https://www.bime.ntu.edu.tw/English/Default.html) at National Taiwan University (NTU). While at NTU, I worked with [Dr. Ping-Lang Yen](http://ai.robo.ntu.edu.tw/en/personal.php?id=70) on agricultural robots and built the first human-robot collaborative tea harvesting vehicle in Taiwan.
